Would analyse the average danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo columns
Then use this data to decide what kind of songs they enjoy.

But this could be flawed if a user listened to 30 songs on a playlist they liked often and the other 70 just happened
to be listened to once or twice in the year.
This would shadow out the songs the user actually liked and give equal importance to each song in the top 100
instead of giving those at the top of the list a higher importance.
